  h2 What is Halbert?

  p
    ' Halbert is an environment for bootstrapping an idea or for getting
    ' the hang of a concept.  With JQuery, Coffeescript, Slim Templates,
    ' Twitter's bootstrap styling, and SCSS you've got the basics of
    ' everything you need to get going quickly.

  h2 How can I customize it?

  p
    ' The typical user will clone the github repository.  Thereafter go to
    ' town!  Here's a breakdown of the files you'll want to play with:

  p
    b public/javascripts/custom:
    ' put your *.coffee files here.  You
    ' will need to compile them yourself (either through a vim hook as
    ' provided in vim_options.vim, or by manually compiling them with the
    ' coffee command, or through the Rake task 'assets:cs'
  p
    b public/stylesheets/custom:
    ' put your custom SCSS in 'custom.css'.
    ' You, again, will need to compile it into CSS using a vim hook, the scss
    ' command, or running the Rake task 'assets:scss'
  p
    b public/views/index.slim, layout.slim:
    ' These are the view files.
    ' Edit their (this page's) content.
