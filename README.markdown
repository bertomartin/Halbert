# Halbert

## Purpose

Programming should be easy to explore with minimal muss and fuss.  To this end,
I have crated Halbert: a small little "shell" that allows you to get going with
less effort.  It includes the stack that I'm currently using at work running
on a small, lite server, Sinatra.

The stack:

  1.  Coffeescript
  1.  SCSS
  1.  JQuery
  1.  Twitter Bootstrap

I plan on creating various branches off of this, but the nice thing is that
all that's required is a `rackup` and then you're good to try something
out in the JS console, write some custom SCSS (use my included vim code
to execute a "\sc" `sass compile`.

I admit, it's nothing particularly groundbreaking, but it lets you just
get to hacking with nice, pretty tools.

## Naming

Named after Tom Halbert, my first CS professor in high school who
admonished students to create "shell" for easy cut and pasting so that
we could get to the the business of coding more quickly.
